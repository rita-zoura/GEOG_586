This is Heritage station, I just have to walk 5 min to hop on the to the train and head toward the University, which is only about a 30 min train ride. Buses like the 3 can easily take me downtown, and the 20 can also take me to the University if the trains go down (as they usually do in the winter time lol)");

I remember when i was a kid, Canada Day fireworks used to be launched from there. I'm pretty sure I saw the 100th anniversary of Canada fireworks there as they were launched over the Glenmore Reservoir. Recently we just go to center street as I don't think they launch near us anymore.");

When it's not too cold to go for a walk outside, me and my family would go up and take a walk around in evening, you can see the sun set arcoss the water and its really really refreshing, relaxing and just all around nice to watch as you walk around for a bit. Even during this quarantine I've gone around the pathway with my friends on socially distanced walks to enjoy the outdoors for a bit after being inside at home for so long. Many people in the city enjoy biking around the entire thing and going to the north and south parks for picnics and barbeque's!");

When I started at Woodman Jr. High in Gr. 7, I was really excited to be starting a school year without my brother being at the same school as me. Little did I know that Woodman had just introduced grades 5 and 6 that same year and my parents had him trasfered so that we could still be together. We would walk and bike to and from school. Only grades 7-9 were allowed off school grounds for lunch so many of us would go across to Dairy Queen for a blizzard.");
